    "### Simplified Definition of `with` Statement in Python  \n",
    "The `with` statement is used to handle resources (like files) safely and automatically. It ensures that the resource is **opened**, **used**, and then **closed** properly, even if an error occurs.  \n",
    "### **Safely:**\n",
    "- Ensures that the resource (like a file or connection) is properly **released or closed**, even if something goes wrong (e.g., an error or exception).\n",
    "- Prevents issues like memory leaks, locked files, or unresponsive connections that can occur if resources aren't closed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Automatically:**\n",
    "- The resource is **opened and closed for you** without needing extra code (e.g., no need to write `file.close()`).\n",
    "- Python handles the cleanup when the `with` block ends, regardless of whether the block completes successfully or an error occurs.\n",

    "### Example: Difference Between `with` and Without `with`  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Without `with`**\n",
    "You need to manually open and close the file:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'w')  # Open the file\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file.write('Hello, World!')  # Write to the file\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()  # Close the file manually\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**:  \n",
    "If you forget to call `close()` or an error occurs, the file might remain open, which can cause issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **With `with`**\n",
    "Python automatically handles opening and closing:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:  # Open the file\n",
    "    file.write('Hello, World!')  # Write to the file\n",
    "# File is automatically closed here, even if an error occurs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**:  \n",
    "- No need to call `close()` yourself.\n",
    "- Resource cleanup is guaranteed, making the code safer and cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:  \n",
    "- **Without `with`** = You do all the work (manually closing).  \n",
    "- **With `with`** = Python does the cleanup for you.\n",
