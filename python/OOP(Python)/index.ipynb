    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Class Methods**:\n",
    "- A **class method** takes `cls` (representing the class itself) as the first parameter instead of `self`.\n",
    "- It can modify class-level attributes but cannot access instance-level attributes directly.\n",
    "- It is defined using the `@classmethod` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Static Methods**:\n",
    "- A **static method** does not take `self` or `cls` as the first parameter.\n",
    "- It cannot modify class or instance attributes but is still related to the class conceptually.\n",
    "- It is defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Instance Method (`introduce`)**:\n",
    "   - Works on instance attributes `self.name` and `self.age` and provides a personalized introduction for each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Method (`change_species`)**:\n",
    "   - Takes `cls` as the first parameter (refers to the class itself).\n",
    "   - Modifies the class-level attribute `species` for all instances of the class. In the example, we changed the species from `\"Human\"` to `\"Superhuman\"` for all instances of `Person`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Static Method (`is_adult`)**:\n",
    "   - Does not operate on instance or class attributes.\n",
    "   - Acts as a general utility function that checks whether a person is an adult (based on age).\n",
    "   - It can be called using the class name directly (i.e., `Person.is_adult()`) or via an instance, but it has no direct access to either `self` or `cls`.\n",

    "###  Operator Overriding**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Operator overriding is a specific case of operator overloading where you redefine the behavior of an operator in a subclass that was already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: It allows you to customize or extend the behavior of an operator for a subclass.\n",
    "- **How It Works**: You define the same special method (e.g., `__add__`, `__eq__`, etc.) in the subclass to override the behavior inherited from the superclass.\n",
