    "# Understanding Parameter Passing in Python: Reference, Immutability, and Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, understanding how parameters are passed into functions is crucial to writing efficient and bug-free code. Python uses a mechanism known as **pass-by-reference** when passing parameters to functions, but the behavior differs based on whether the object is mutable or immutable. In this article, we'll explore how this mechanism works with **mutable** and **immutable** types, explaining the concept with the help of code examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What Does \"Passing by Reference\" Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we pass an object to a function, Python does not pass the **value** directly. Instead, it passes a **reference** to the object. This means that inside the function, you are working with the same object as the one outside the function. However, the behavior varies based on whether the object is **mutable** or **immutable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Immutable Types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immutable types** are those whose value cannot be changed after creation. Examples of immutable types include:\n",
    "- **Integers**\n",
    "- **Booleans**\n",
    "- **Floats**\n",
    "- **Strings**\n",
    "- **Tuples**\n",
    "\n",
    "When an immutable object is passed to a function, the function cannot modify the original object. If you attempt to change the value of the object inside the function, a new object will be created instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Passing an Immutable Type (Integer)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def change(value):\n",
    "    value = 2  # A new object is created, old value is not modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "val = 1  # Initial value is 1\n",
    "change(val)\n",
    "print(val)  # Output: 1 (The original value remains unchanged)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- In the function `change`, the assignment `value = 2` creates a new integer object, and `value` now refers to this new object.\n",
    "- However, the original variable `val` remains unchanged outside the function. This demonstrates that **integers** are immutable, and a change inside the function does not affect the original object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Mutable Types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutable types** are those whose value can be modified after creation. Common examples of mutable types in Python include:\n",
    "- **Lists**\n",
    "- **Dictionaries**\n",
    "- **Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a mutable object is passed to a function, modifications inside the function will affect the original object outside the function because both the function and the caller share the same reference to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Passing a Mutable Type (List)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def modify_list(lst):\n",
    "    lst[0] = 99  # The first element of the list is modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # Initial list\n",
    "modify_list(my_list)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [99, 2, 3] (The original list is modified)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- In the function `modify_list`, `lst[0] = 99` modifies the first element of the **same list** object.\n",
    "- Since lists are mutable, the change reflects outside the function. Both the function and the caller are working with the same reference to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Combining Immutable and Mutable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a case where both an immutable and a mutable object are passed to a function together. We will see how changes affect the original objects for both types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Passing Both Immutable and Mutable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def modify(value, lst):\n",
    "    value = 10  # Immutable: A new integer object is created.\n",
    "    lst[1] = 42  # Mutable: The second element of the list is modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "num = 5\n",
    "my_list = [0, 1, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "modify(num, my_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(num)      # Output: 5 (Immutable: The value is not changed)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [0, 42, 2] (Mutable: The list is modified)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- `num` is an integer (immutable). Inside the function, when we assign `value = 10`, it creates a new integer object, leaving the original `num` unchanged.\n",
    "- `my_list` is a list (mutable). Inside the function, the modification `lst[1] = 42` affects the original list, and the change is reflected outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Key Differences Between Immutable and Mutable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, here are the key points about how **mutable** and **immutable** objects behave when passed to functions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutable Objects:\n",
    "- Cannot be modified after creation.\n",
    "- When passed to a function, any modification creates a new object and does not affect the original.\n",
    "- Examples: integers, booleans, floats, strings, tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutable Objects:\n",
    "- Can be modified after creation.\n",
    "- When passed to a function, changes to the object inside the function are reflected outside because both the caller and the function share the same reference to the object.\n",
    "- Examples: lists, dictionaries, sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, parameters are passed by reference, meaning the function receives a reference to the original object. However, the behavior of passing objects differs based on whether the object is mutable or immutable. When working with immutable objects (such as integers or strings), changes inside the function do not affect the original object. Conversely, with mutable objects (like lists or dictionaries), changes inside the function are reflected outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these distinctions is crucial for writing code that behaves as expected and avoids unintended side effects. By knowing when an object is mutable or immutable, you can better manage how your function interacts with parameters and ensures that your code is both efficient and bug-free.\n",
