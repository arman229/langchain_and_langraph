    "Once upon a time, deep in a lush green jungle, lived a boy named Mika.  Mika wasn't like the other children in his village. While they played near their homes, Mika loved exploring the jungle, his bare feet padding softly on the damp earth. He knew the secrets of the whispering trees, the hidden paths through the thick vines, and the songs of the brightly colored birds.\n",
    "\n",
    "One sweltering afternoon, while searching for juicy mangoes, Mika stumbled upon a tiny lion cub, huddled under a giant banyan tree.  The cub was skinny, its fur matted with dirt, and its eyes were dull with hunger.  It whimpered softly, a tiny, pathetic sound that tugged at Mika's heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mika, though a little scared, felt sorry for the little lion. He carefully approached, offering the mango he'd been saving. The cub, hesitant at first, cautiously sniffed the fruit before gobbling it down in a few quick bites.  Mika smiled. He shared the rest of his mangoes with the cub, and the little lion seemed to purr with happiness, rubbing its head against Mika's leg.\n",
    "\n",
    "From that day on, Mika and the lion cub, whom he named Leo, became the best of friends.  Mika would visit Leo every day, bringing him fruits, berries, and sometimes even scraps of fish from his family's dinner.  Leo, in return, would playfully chase butterflies with Mika, his tiny paws padding silently through the undergrowth.  They played hide-and-seek amongst the giant trees, Leo's golden fur blending perfectly with the sunlight filtering through the leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "One day, Mika noticed Leo was growing bigger and stronger.  His fur was shiny and healthy, and his eyes sparkled with mischief.  Mika knew it was time for Leo to return to his pride.  He felt a pang of sadness, but he also knew it was the right thing to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a heavy heart, Mika led Leo to a clearing where he saw a group of lions resting in the shade.  A large lioness, who Mika guessed was Leo's mother, looked up and let out a soft roar of recognition.  Leo bounded towards her, nuzzling his head against her side.  The lioness licked Leo's head affectionately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mika watched as Leo joined his family, a happy tear rolling down his cheek.  He knew he would miss his friend terribly, but the joy of having helped Leo survive filled his heart.  He waved goodbye, and as he walked back through the jungle, he knew he would always remember his special friendship with the little lion cub, Leo.  And every time he heard a lion roar in the distance, he smiled, knowing his friend was safe and happy.\n",
