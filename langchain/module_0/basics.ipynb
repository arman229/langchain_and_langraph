        "## Context\n",
        "\n",
        "At LangChain, we aim to make it easy to build LLM applications. One type of LLM application you can build is an agent. There’s a lot of excitement around building agents because they can automate a wide range of tasks that were previously impossible.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice though, it is incredibly difficult to build systems that reliably execute on these tasks. As we’ve worked with our users to put agents into production, we’ve learned that more control is often necessary. You might need an agent to always call a specific tool first or use different prompts based on its state.\n",
        "\n",
        "To tackle this problem, we’ve built [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) — a framework for building agent and multi-agent applications. Separate from the LangChain package, LangGraph’s core design philosophy is to help developers add better precision and control into agent workflows, suitable for the complexity of real-world systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Course Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "The course is structured as a set of modules, with each module focused on a particular theme related to LangGraph. You will see a folder for each module, which contains a series of notebooks. A video will accompany each notebook to help walk through the concepts, but the notebooks are also stand-alone, meaning that they contain explanations and can be viewed independent of the videos. Each module folder also contains a `studio` folder, which contains a set of graphs that can be loaded into [LangGraph Studio](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio), our IDE for building LangGraph applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you begin, please follow the instructions in the `README` to create an environment and install dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Chat models\n",
        "\n",
        "In this course, we'll be using [Chat Models](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#chat-models), which do a few things take a sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages as outputs. LangChain does not host any Chat Models, rather we rely on third party integrations. [Here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/chat/) is a list of 3rd party chat model integrations within LangChain! By default, the course with use [GEMINI_API_KEY](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key/) because it is both popular and performant. As noted, please ensure that you have an `GEMINI_API_KEY`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's check that your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set and, if not, you will be asked to enter it."

        "The `%%capture` magic command in Jupyter notebooks is used to capture the output of a cell and suppress the display of output in the notebook. It can be especially useful when you want to suppress standard output (stdout) and error messages (stderr) from being displayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Explanation of the components**:\n",
        "- `%%capture`: This is a cell magic command. It captures the output of all code in the cell, including standard output and standard error, and stores it in a variable or simply suppresses it.\n",
        "- `--no-stderr`: This is an optional flag that tells Jupyter to capture only the standard output (stdout) and **not** the standard error (stderr). If there are errors in the code, they won't be captured or suppressed, and they will still be shown in the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Usage Example**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "%%capture --no-stderr\n",
        "print(\"This is a normal output.\")\n",
        "raise ValueError(\"This is an error message.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "- The **normal output** (`print(\"This is a normal output.\")`) would be captured and suppressed.\n",
        "- The **error message** (`ValueError(\"This is an error message.\")`) would still be shown because the `--no-stderr` flag is used, which ensures errors are not suppressed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What happens with the captured output?**\n",
        "If you want to access the captured output later, you can store it in a variable:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "%%capture captured_output\n",
        "print(\"This will be captured.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "You can then retrieve and use the captured output:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "captured_output.show()  # This will display the captured output\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Summary**:\n",
        "- `%%capture` suppresses output in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
        "- `--no-stderr` ensures that **only standard output (stdout)** is captured, and **standard error (stderr)** is shown.\n",
        "- It is useful when you want to prevent clutter in your notebook, especially for commands or code that produce unnecessary output."
