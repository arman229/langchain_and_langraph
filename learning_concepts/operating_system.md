# **📌 Notes on Operating Systems, Windows, Linux, and Terminals**

## **1. What is an Operating System (OS)?**
✅ An **OS is software** that controls the entire computer, including hardware (CPU, memory, storage) and software (applications).  
✅ It allows users to **run programs**, **manage files**, and **interact** with the system through a graphical or text-based interface.  

### **Examples of OS:**  
🔹 **Windows** – Used in personal computers and offices.  
🔹 **Linux** – Used in servers, cybersecurity, and programming.  
🔹 **macOS** – Used in Apple MacBooks and iMacs.  
🔹 **Android/iOS** – Used in mobile devices.

## **2. Difference Between Windows and Linux**  

| Feature | **Windows** | **Linux** |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Cost** | Paid (requires a license) | Free (open-source) |
| **Customization** | Limited | Highly customizable |
| **Security** | More vulnerable to viruses | More secure |
| **Performance** | Good for gaming & office work | Better for servers & programming |
| **Usage** | Home users, gaming, business | Developers, cybersecurity, servers |

### **Windows OS**  
✅ **Developed by Microsoft** – Mostly used for personal and office work.  
✅ **Easy to use** – Uses a graphical user interface (GUI).  
✅ **Paid license** – Requires activation to use full features.  

### **Linux OS**  
✅ **Free & Open-source** – Anyone can use or modify it.  
✅ **More Secure** – Fewer viruses compared to Windows.  
✅ **Popular for Developers** – Used in programming, hacking, and servers.

## **3. What is a Terminal?**  
A **Terminal** is a tool that lets you interact with the OS by typing commands instead of clicking icons.  

### **Types of Terminals:**  
🔹 **Command Prompt (cmd.exe)** → Basic command-line tool in Windows.  
🔹 **PowerShell** → Advanced Windows shell with scripting abilities.  
🔹 **Linux Terminal (Bash, Zsh)** → Used for running Linux commands.

## **4. PowerShell vs. Linux Terminal**  

| Feature | **PowerShell (Windows)** | **Linux Terminal** |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **OS** | Windows | Linux/macOS |
| **Shell Type** | Object-based (cmdlets) | Text-based (commands) |
| **Linux Command Support** | Limited (needs WSL) | Full Linux support |
| **Scripting Language** | PowerShell scripts (.ps1) | Bash scripts (.sh) |

### **PowerShell (Windows)**
✅ Advanced command-line tool with automation features.  
✅ Can run **some Linux commands** if Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is installed.  

### **Linux Terminal**
✅ Default command-line tool in Linux and macOS.  
✅ Supports full Linux commands and scripting.

## **5. How Programs Run in Windows and Linux?**
When you **run a program** or **type a command**, the OS follows these steps:  

1️⃣ **User gives a command** (e.g., open a file or run a program).  
2️⃣ **OS communicates with hardware** (CPU, memory, storage).  
3️⃣ **OS loads and executes the program** (displays results on screen).  
4️⃣ **OS manages background tasks** (multiple apps running).
