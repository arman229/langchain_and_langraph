    "When you create a new file in **Google Colab** (which is also called a \"notebook\"), Google provides you with access to a **virtual machine (VM)** to run your code. Let me explain this process in easy words:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Virtual Machine (VM)**: \n",
    "   - A virtual machine is like a computer inside a computer. It's a virtual version of a physical computer that runs on the cloud (a powerful server hosted by Google). \n",
    "   - When you open a new Colab notebook, Google gives you access to one of these virtual machines so you can run Python code, AI models, and other tasks as if you were working on a powerful computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Components of the VM**:\n",
    "   - The VM comes with **CPU** by default, which you can use for general computing tasks.\n",
    "   - You can also request to use a **GPU** or **TPU** in the VM if you need more power, like for AI or deep learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How it works**:\n",
    "   - When you create a new notebook, Google connects you to this virtual machine. All the code you run in the notebook (like Python code or AI model training) is executed on the VM.\n",
    "   - Google provides you with some space for **storage** and the ability to install libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.), just like you would on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Different Hardware Options**:\n",
    "   - By default, you get a **CPU** VM for free.\n",
    "   - If you need more processing power for AI tasks, you can **switch to a GPU or TPU** from the menu. This makes it faster to train AI models or run data science computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: When you create a new notebook in Google Colab, Google gives you a virtual computer (VM) with a CPU (and optionally GPU/TPU). This virtual computer runs in the cloud, so you don’t have to use your own machine’s power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that make sense? Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any part of this!"
