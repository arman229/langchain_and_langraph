 
### **1. High-Level Language (Needs a Compiler or Interpreter)**  
- High-level languages (like Rust, Python, Java) **cannot be directly understood by the CPU**.  
- They need a **compiler (e.g., Rust, C, C++)** or **interpreter (e.g., Python, JavaScript)** to **convert** the code into **machine code (binary: 0s and 1s)**.  
- **Example:**  
  - Rust: `println!("Hi");` → **(Compiler)** → Machine Code → CPU executes it.  
  - Python: `print("Hi")` → **(Interpreter line by line)** → Machine Code → CPU executes it.

### **2. Low-Level Language (Still Needs an Assembler!)**  
- Low-level languages (like Assembly) are **closer to machine code** but **not** directly executable.  
- They still need an **Assembler** to convert Assembly code into machine code.  
- **Example:**  
  - Assembly: `mov eax, 1` → **(Assembler)** → Machine Code → CPU executes it.
