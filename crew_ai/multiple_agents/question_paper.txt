1.  **Correct Answer:** d) `my_string = Hello, world!`

    **Explanation:**  In Python, strings must be enclosed in either single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or triple quotes (''' ''' or """ """).  Option d) is missing the necessary quotes.


2.  **Correct Answer:** c) `[1, 3, 4, 5]`

    **Explanation:** The `pop(2)` method removes the element at index 2 (the third element) from `my_list`.  Therefore, the list becomes `[1, 3, 4, 5]`.


3.  **Correct Answer:** b) To handle potential errors during program execution.

    **Explanation:** The `try...except` block is a fundamental error-handling mechanism in Python.  It allows you to gracefully handle exceptions (errors) that might occur during the execution of a code block, preventing the program from crashing.
